## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Web interface
- `GET /api/status` - Get current status (JSON)
- `GET /api/status/<status>` - Set status (for testing)

## Status Types

1. **Open** ðŸŸ¢ - Courts are available for normal play
2. **Closed** ðŸ”´ - Courts are not available (weather, maintenance, hours)
3. **Critically Open** ðŸŸ¡ - Courts available for emergency/priority access only
4. **Critically Closed** âš« - Courts closed due to emergency conditions

## Automatic Status Logic

The system automatically updates status based on:
- **Time**: Courts closed outside 6 AM - 8 PM
- **Weather**: Closed if precipitation > 50% or temperature < 35Â°F or > 95Â°F
- **Manual Override**: Admin can override automatic status via Telegram

## Security

- Only authorized Telegram users can control the system
- User IDs must be configured in environment variables
- Bot token should be kept secure

## Development

To run in development mode:

```bash
export FLASK_ENV=development
export FLASK_DEBUG=True
python app.py
```

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Use a production WSGI server (gunicorn, uwsgi)
2. Set up proper environment variables
3. Use a real database instead of in-memory storage
4. Set up proper logging and monitoring
5. Use HTTPS for the web interface

Example with gunicorn:
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```
